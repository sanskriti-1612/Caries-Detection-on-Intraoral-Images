# Caries-Detection-on-Intraoral-Images
Dental cavities impact over 3.9 billion people worldwide. Dental caries are one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world. According to World Health Organization report on oral health, worldwide 60 to 90 percent of school children and nearly 80 percent of adults experienced dental caries.Typically, cavity detection requires a trained dentist. However, barriers such as dentophobia, limited dentist availability, and lack of dental insurance prevent millions from receiving dental care. A dental diagnosis requires time, a medical professional, and money. These Three things, millions of people globally donâ€™t have. Furthermore, chances of proper cavity diagnoses are lowered in developing nations, as the dentist to patient ratio can be disproportionate. Factors such as cost and limited availability of dentists often prevent people from receiving proper cavity diagnoses. To address these issues, a cavity diagnosing system using an artificial intelligence (AI) approach would be advantageous to increase access to dental care at lower costs. Hence, accurate detection of dental caries, in particular at the early stages, can greatly improve the quality of dental care.
### Objectives -
1. To provide early detection of tooth decay.
2. To replace laser fluorescence, which is a dental caries detection device, with the project.
3. To make it user-friendly regardless of where the user is.
### Methodology - 
1. Capturing teeth photos through an android phone
2. Checking if teeth are clearly visible through deep learning model one
3. Sending photos to the trained deep learning model to check for caries
4. Model two will process the photos and return the result
5. The application will display the probability of caries
### Technology - 
1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) - Algorithm for developing the deep learning
model
2. Keras - It is a high-level, deep learning API written in Python for implementing neural networks.
3. TensorFlow - Used for building and training machine learning models, especially deep learning models. Provides a flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources that enable creation and deploymet of various types of machine learning models.
### Conclusion - 
For our model, we have successfully used the algorithm of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the results as effectively as possible. After vigorously testing and validating our model, the maximum accuracy obtained in our testing phase was 85% for 10 epochs and 11 layer configurations.
